Customer Personality Analysis is a critical process that enables businesses to gain a deep understanding of their customer segments. By analyzing customer data, businesses can separate their customer base into distinct groups based on various characteristics, needs, behaviors, and preferences. 

The key objective of customer personality analysis is to optimize marketing efforts and product development by identifying and targeting specific customer segments that are more likely to engage with and purchase particular products. Rather than investing resources in marketing a product to every customer within a businessâ€™s database, customer personality analysis helps identify which customer segment is most likely to respond to a given product and marketing effort. By focusing on these high-potential segments, businesses can enhance marketing efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive higher sales.

Intially we have four different data files, two of them are in CSV and two are in JSON. We use AWS services such as S3, Glue, Lambda, and more, to do the ETL process. A more detailed use of all these services are mentioned in the report along with the screenshots of how the process was done.
